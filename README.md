#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

In the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I improved accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for our users.

### Install on your PC

1. Clone this repo git clone https://github.com/mirkoweb88/mws-restaurant-stage/

2.

### Run on localhost

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

### Note
You'll need your own Google Maps API key. Replace the text YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
